This is my first bot I've ever written in TS. Moreover, the plan for this project was to make it small and simple that would be used by me and my friends.
The code is pretty clunky as I was still in the process of learning Node, TS and discord.js. Revisiting the code after some time made me realize how bad it is. ¬†

This is why I've decided to rewrite the bot from scratch, implementing new, more efficient features and greatly improve code quality. ¬†
My next goal is to make the bot more user-friendly (Both for the people that want to host it themselves and for the people that want to use it as it is). I'm also planning to learn some front-end framework and create a fully functioning dashboard for the bot.
